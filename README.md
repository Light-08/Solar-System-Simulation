# Solar System Simulation

THIS IS THE BEGINNER LEVEL IN GAME DESIGNING AND DEVELOPMENT.

This application is the basic implementation of Unity engine using C#. This is a simple simulation of our solar system which includes -

    1. SUN ROTATING AROUND ITS AXIS
    2. ALL PLANETS REVOLVING AROUND THE SUN AND ROTATING AROUND THEIR AXES
    3. A SINGLE MOON OF THE EARTH REVOLVING AROUND EARTH
    4. COMETS PASSING BY RANDOMLY SPAWNING AND GETTING DESTROYED AFTER A WHILE
    5. LIGHTINGS, BACKGROUND, CAMERA, SECONDARY CAMERA AT THE LEFT BOTTOM, SOUND EFFECTS
    6. TRAILING PATH LIGHT SHOWING FOR ALL PLANETS
    7. BY CLICKING ON ANY OBJECT, THE CAMERA SHIFTS TO VIEW FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE

What can you do?

    1. ADD MORE OBJECTS LIKE ASTEROIDS ROAMING HERE N THERE
    2. ASTEROID BELT AROUND JUPITER
    3. RINGS OF SATURN
    4. OTHER PROMINENT MOONS OF OTHER PLANETS
    5. ADD SOME EXCITING FEATURES, LIKE WHEN YOU CLICK ON ANY OBJECT A BRIEF THEORY AND HISTORY ABOUT THEM APPEARS WRITTEN IN A BOX
    6. SPLASH SCREEN...etc
    
SO, YOU CAN LET YOUR IMAGINATION RUN WILD AND JUST PLAY WITH IT...ENJOY!
